# Lore

Lore, also hosted as [lore.pub](https://lore.pub), is a software for creators and users of fictional worlds.

The goal is a platform that makes it easy to publish and modify fictional worlds, both for publishers to make available what they already have and for their fans, creators and players to continue building on those worlds. It's especially suitable for Table-top Roleplaying (TTRPG), where it makes it possible for players stories to exist in a shared, living universe. Your game session can impact mine, and we both have access to all of the fiction, digitally. A sort of MMORPG, but for tabletop RPG.

Lore can be likened to a wiki or a content management system, but purpose built for fictional worlds.

Lore is currently closed source but parts will be open sourced under a suitable license. While Lore is used in production, parts of the software can be considered alpha or beta level. You can read more about [Lore's goal and vision here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10eiuf4RGQXO7J6DVP3xWVH91XBhJHI6-9Y9y-GWn9_s/edit?usp=sharing).

These pages contains the **documentation** for Lore, with content for both **developers** and **users**. The code and documentation is a work in progress, but it felt better to get what exists online even if it means there will be some obvious holes or inaccuracies.
