# How Lore can compete?

- Good design: Most competitors clearly has outdated or poor design, cluttered, etc. Lore is aiming for a Medium type cleanliness.
- Author-friendly: By making it easy to import data (even from competitors above?) we make it easy to get started.
- Topic maps: The ability to easily link anything to anything, and also to reference content resources both within and outside.
- Generated content: By focusing on the ability to easily generate new content and some AI-branding, we go further than others.
- Pluggabilty: Some others already have this, but if we can gather developers to easily create functionality, we can gain a lot.
- The content: If we use it for our own content, at least we gain some traction with our existing customers.

But overall, the space is surprisingly crowded already, considering it's catering to a niche market.
