On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same
as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures
to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

There are four typical ways an image can be shown on Lore.

### Wide
An image that covers the full page width. Used for page headers and eye catching images in the middle
of long articles. Text may be superimposed on these images in e.g. page headers, so avoid using images with text
or control the display of text on top using custom CSS.

Best uploaded in sizes of 2400px wide, 400px height (or more). By default, wide images are not scaled.
It means that if the viewport is less than 2400px, the left and right edges will start to be hidden. The height of the
viewport will be 500px or less. If the image is higher than 400px, it will create a parallax effect revealing
more of the top and bottom edges as you scroll. The only area guaranteed to be visible on all devices therefore is in a
square of roughly 400px wide and 400px high in the center.

- gallery-wide
- ![This is the a wide image](http://placehold.it/2400x600.png)

{%- endcall -%}

{% filter markdown %}
### Center
An image that will be shown inline with text paragraphs, and will therefore be scaled up or down
to whatever the width of the text paragraph is. The best original size is 1600px wide, and any height.
{% endfilter %}

- gallery-card
- ![This is the card image, a good place to have a longer description here](http://placehold.it/800x800.png)
{%- endcall -%}
{% filter markdown %}
### Card
An image that will be shown as a playing card or portrait, either on the side of an article (with text
flowing around it) or in listings using the card view. The image will be scaled to fit within the card size, which is
usually 250px wide. However, the best original size for images intended for cards is 800px wide, and between 800px to
1120px high, to ensure that the aspect ratio is between 1:1 and 2.5:3.5. Currently, a playing card is fixed to the
container size of width: 258px and height: 363px.
{% endfilter %}


{% filter markdown %}

### Icon
An image used for small displays. The best original size is 200px wide and high or more, and aspect ratio should be 1:1.

#### Notes about images

* An article with attached images will automatically use the widest one for header image, and the tallest one for card image.
It means you don't have to create all these different images, you could use the same image for all, but it would look less
nice.
* An upcoming feature will resize images in sizes from 2400px down to 400px wide in steps of 400px, so that
we only need to send the image with the right amount of pixels to the device. This will be handled automatically and you
don't need to worry.
* Image formats should be PNG or JPG when uploaded.
* In articles images can be grouped together in lists to form a gallery. The gallery will still be in the format of wide,
center or card, but the images will be scaled to fit as a masonry within.
